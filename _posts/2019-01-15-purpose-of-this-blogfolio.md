Whenever I have thoughts on a subject or life experience, I usually mull it over in private, write it in a journal, or try to discuss it with a friend. I’ve realized now, after looking back at my past few years in school, that I should document my thoughts and journey through life as a public record to track my personal (and writing skill) growth over time. And in case others are asking questions about the same topics or going through similar experiences, they can hear the thoughts of another (real) human online! These posts could be book summaries, the tech I use, why I do things a certain way, how to cook a dish, or about something I’m doing irl.

In addition, I would like to document my tech experiences and thoughts about tech such as fun or interesting programming questions and code I’ve ran into, summaries of research papers, or even simple tech tutorials. Due to the nature of Computer Science and software development, whenever I want to start a new project, I spend hours just reading documentation to get the simplest of things setup (it took me a 3 days to get a fully deployable, working Docker at my last internship… and this didn’t include the deployment part). Knowing this, I procrastinate starting a project in a language or framework I’m not familiar with. That is, until I find a magical guide that acts as a very introductory guide to accomplishing the initial goals of the project. For example, when I was making the Docker at my internship, I found a good guide on Medium to help me get _started_ at least. Or even this blogfolio! I have little web dev experience, so I procrastinated making this site for months because I had no idea where to start. But then I found out I can fork a Jekyll theme and host it for free on Github Pages! I would like to pay it forward and do the same for other users, documenting my foray into unfamiliar tech stacks in order to make learning new tech stacks or starting new projects a more accessible endeavor for all (that’s the optimist in me talking).

I would like to say upfront, that as a personal goal, I want to post at least once every month or two. There is no consistent schedule. I understand that is a very low frequency, but this blogfolio[^1] is not built for profit, “SEO optimization,” or to gain a massive, regular audience. It is to be used as an outlet for my mind, as a resource for other users, and a documentation of my life. This website will be a work in progress for a long time. I want to use this website as a testing grounds for me to learn web dev (hosting, porting, CSS, etc) over time, so if the website looks different every month or a link is broken, I pushed a broken build during my experimentation[^2]! I expect to edit files after posting them. If the edit is minor (spelling, grammar, restructuring) I will not note it, but the page should provide a “modified on” date. If it is a major edit, I will denote it somehow (strikethrough, note at the top or bottom, etc). If you feel like a major change in a post has occurred and I did not note it, you can always check the source code on my [Github][1] to confirm, and if that is the case, please email me at momen.abdelkarim@gmail.com.

[^1]:	Blog + portfolio. I plan on utilizing this site to both host my blog and my technical portfolio.

[^2]:	You can still use the search functionality to find a post if the links are broken.
