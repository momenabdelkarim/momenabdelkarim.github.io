Whenever I have thoughts on a subject or life experience, I usually mull it over in private, write it in a journal, or try to discuss it with a friend. I’ve realized now, after looking back at my past few years in school, that I should document my thoughts and journey through life as a public record to track my personal (and writing skill) growth over time. And in case others are asking questions about the same topics or going through similar experiences, they can hear the thoughts of another (real) human online! These posts could be book summaries, the tech I use, why I do things a certain way, or about something I’m doing irl.

In addition, I would like to document my tech experiences and thoughts about tech such as fun or interesting programming questions, summaries of research papers, or even simple tutorials. Due to the nature of Computer Science and software development, whenever I want to start a new project, I spend hours just reading documentation to get the simplest of things setup. Knowing this, I procrastinate starting a project in a language or framework I’m not familiar with.

 Over the last few years, I’ve deleted all my social media accounts—Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat.
